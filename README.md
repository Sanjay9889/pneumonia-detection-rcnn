# pneumonia-detection-rcnn

This project aims to detect pneumonia in chest X-ray images using Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN). Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that can be life-threatening, especially in vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly. Early detection of pneumonia through chest X-ray analysis can aid in timely treatment and improve patient outcomes.

## Introduction
Pneumonia detection is traditionally performed by radiologists through visual examination of chest X-ray images. However, this process can be time-consuming and subjective, leading to delays in diagnosis and potential misinterpretations. Automated methods leveraging deep learning techniques offer a promising solution to assist radiologists in quickly and accurately identifying pneumonia cases.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of automatically detecting pneumonia in chest X-ray images. Specifically, we employ the RCNN architecture, which combines region proposal networks with convolutional neural networks to localize and classify objects within an image.

## Dataset
We use the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle, which contains thousands of chest X-ray images labeled as either normal or pneumonia. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets for model training, validation, and evaluation, respectively.

## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing: 
Chest X-ray images are preprocessed to enhance contrast and remove noise, ensuring optimal 
input quality for the deep learning model.

### Model Architecture:
We employ the RCNN architecture, consisting of a region proposal network (RPN) and a 
convolutional neural network (CNN). The RPN generates region proposals (bounding boxes) likely to contain objects of interest, which are then fed into the CNN for feature extraction and classification.

### Model Training: 
The RCNN model is trained on the training dataset using a combination of binary cross-entropy loss 
and mean squared error loss to optimize both localization and classification performance.

### Model Evaluation: 
The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset to assess its performance in terms of accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, we visualize the model's predictions to gain insights into its strengths and limitations.

## Results
The RCNN model achieves promising results in pneumonia detection, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness across different chest X-ray images. Detailed performance metrics and visualizations are provided in the project report.

## Conclusion
Automated pneumonia detection using deep learning techniques shows great potential for improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in clinical settings. Further refinement and validation of the RCNN model may lead to its integration into healthcare systems, ultimately benefiting patients and healthcare providers alike.
